# ── Task A ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Did the weather tool return outdoor_ok = True or False?
TASK_A_OUTDOOR_OK = True

TASK_A_NOTES = "After fixing tool-call parsing in research_agent.py, the agent made five tool calls in sequence. It checked two venues, then calculated catering, checked weather, and generated a flyer."

# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
The pivot happened immediately after the tool result for The Bow Bar showed status='full' and meets_all_constraints=false. The agent then checked The Haymarket Vaults, The Guilford Arms, and The Albanach instead of insisting on the first venue.

SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
The function calls show that none of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements for 300 people with vegan options.

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes, this behaviour is acceptable and preferable to hallucinating an answer or calling irrelevant tools. A real booking assistant should clearly state when a request is out of scope, avoid fabricating train times, and ideally hand off to a transport tool or a human workflow.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
The LangGraph graph is compact and generic: one agent node decides dynamically whether to stop or call tools, then loops back after each tool result. By contrast, Rasa CALM flows.yml describes behaviour explicitly as predefined flows and transitions. LangGraph is runtime-flexible, while Rasa is more structured, controlled, and easier to audit step by step.

# ── Reflection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The most unexpected thing the agent did. Min 40 words.
# Must reference a specific behaviour from your run.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
The most unexpected behaviour was in Scenario 1, where the agent did not simply stop after finding The Haymarket Vaults met the constraints. It continued checking more venues, eventually chose The Albanach, then generated a flyer, calculated catering, and checked weather. That showed both initiative and a tendency to over-explore.
