In Part A, all three formatting conditions produced correct answers. This suggests that with a strong model and a clean dataset, the task was easy enough that plain, XML, and sandwich formatting all preserved the relevant constraints well enough for correct venue selection.

Part C showed that even the smaller 8B model answered all three conditions correctly on this dataset. That means the task still did not become difficult enough to reveal a strong formatting advantage, even after switching from the larger model to a smaller one.

CORE_LESSON = """
Context formatting matters most when the task is noisy, ambiguous, long-context, or full of near-miss distractors, and especially when the model is weaker or the instructions are easy to confuse. In simple, clean tasks with strong models, extra structure may add token cost without improving accuracy.
